Hello!

This repository is from my 2D platformer game project called "Costume Champion" developed in Unity Engine for my Game Design program in Vancouver Film School under 2 months.

I was the programmer in the project, so feel free to take a look at what I worked on.

The game is available in the Google Play Store! Check it out here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crusaders.costumechampion
